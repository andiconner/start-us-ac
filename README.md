# Start Us

a fullstack app for local freelance services and businesses.

### Github: https://github.com/cesar863/start-us

### Deployed: https://start-us-team-borderline.herokuapp.com/

## Description 
In this group project we were asked to use the skills and technologies we’ve learned over the past six weeks (server-side JavaScript, RESTful APIs, databases, object-relational mapping, environment variables, templating, and authentication).
We’ll also had to use some of the more conceptual skills we’ve picked up and think like a developer. 

Data is the foundation of full-stack web development. Creating a real-world application means that we can use what we learned about object-oriented programming and object-relational mapping to model real-world objects and processes, using MySQL and Sequelize to connect our application to real data and deploying our application to a service like Heroku that can handle server-side code and data.

## Usage 
The app gives early graduated developers an opportunity to increase their portfolio and coding experience by allowing them to commit to contracts being offered by local small businesses.

And give start up businesses the opportunity to have an online 
presence at a discounted rate by allowing them to create a “Service
Request” detailing what type of service they are looking for and the 
price they are willing to pay.
